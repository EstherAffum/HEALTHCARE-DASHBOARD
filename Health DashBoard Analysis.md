## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of patient healthcare data, offering insights into total patient count, billing amounts, admitted days, insurance issuance, and more. The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com).

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The primary goal of this dashboard is to analyze healthcare trends, patient demographics, medical conditions, and financial aspects of hospital operations. By visualizing these metrics, we aim to:
- Identify key patient trends based on age, gender, and insurance provider.
- Assess medical conditions and their frequency over the years.
- Evaluate billing amounts and the financial impact of patient admissions.
- Improve hospital efficiency and resource allocation.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Total Patients:** 40,235
- **Total Billing Amount:** $1,028M
- **Total Admitted Days:** 624,636
- **Insurance Distribution:** Medicare and Cigna have the highest number of insured patients.
- **Medical Conditions:** Diabetes and Cancer have high occurrence rates.
- **Most Administered Medication:** Lipitor, Ibuprofen, and Aspirin.
- **Gender Distribution:** Nearly equal male and female patient representation.
- **Age Group with the Highest Patients:** Middle-aged (12,506 patients).
- **Blood Type Distribution:** AB+ and O- have the highest frequency.

## âœ… Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Optimize Resource Allocation:** With a high number of admissions for chronic diseases like diabetes and cancer, the hospital should ensure sufficient medical supplies and specialized staff for these conditions.
2. **Enhance Patient Insurance Coverage:** Encouraging more patients to get insured through partnerships with top providers (Cigna, Medicare) can reduce financial burdens.
3. **Medication Management:** Since Lipitor and Ibuprofen are the most prescribed, hospitals should maintain adequate stock levels.
4. **Preventative Healthcare Measures:** Implement awareness programs for lifestyle diseases like diabetes and hypertension to reduce future hospitalization rates.
5. **Improve Data-Driven Decision Making:** Use predictive analytics to anticipate patient admissions, optimize hospital operations, and reduce wait times.
